/**
 * The insights report: the schema the instances imply, plus everything that
 * follows or breaks it. One pure computation feeds both the Home summary card
 * and the full Model Insights page, so their numbers can never disagree.
 *
 * The organizing idea (from real-catalog feedback): a bare outlier list is
 * lint, not insight. Every statement here is one of four honest kinds:
 *
 *   TypeProfile  the inferred schema per type: where instances live, what
 *                they contain (with cardinality), how deep, how they're named
 *   Convention   a norm phrased affirmatively. 100% norms are the site's
 *                implicit modeling documentation, not silence
 *   Deviation    a strong norm with few exceptions, ranked by a Wilson
 *                lower bound (990/1000 outranks 9/10) and EXPLAINED:
 *                outliers are grouped by where they actually sit
 *   Split        a norm whose exceptions are a population, not defects
 *                ("94% under X, 6% under Y"), presented as a distribution
 *
 * WHY A NORM ALSO HAS TO BE INFORMATIVE (MIN_NORM_LIFT)
 *
 * "Do at least 90% of the instances agree?" is only half a test. If a model
 * has exactly one container type, then "Every Pump sits under a Station" is
 * true of Pumps, Valves, Sensors and everything else: it is the shape of the
 * catalog, not a convention Pumps follow. A first pass shipped without this
 * check and produced 51 conventions on a real catalog, most of them true and
 * none of them worth reading, which is how a findings list becomes wallpaper.
 *
 * So every candidate norm is also measured against the catalog-wide base rate
 * for the same pattern, computed over the REST of the catalog (the type's own
 * instances are excluded, or a type that dominates the catalog would set its
 * own baseline and never look surprising). lift = coverage / base rate, and a
 * norm must clear MIN_NORM_LIFT to be "notable". Notable norms are the ones
 * that establish Conventions with exceptions, produce Deviations, and score
 * anomalies. The rest stay in the report, flagged `notable: false`, because
 * they are still true statements about the model; the page folds them away
 * instead of deleting them. When there is nothing to compare against (the
 * catalog is entirely one type) lift is Infinity: the gate only fires on
 * positive evidence that a pattern is unremarkable.
 *
 * No ML, deliberately: every claim is an exact count with its evidence
 * attached, and everything derives from `parentId` links and displayNames,
 * the only facts knowable without per-object round trips. All passes are
 * linear (Maps, no chain re-walks); see insightsReport.perf.test.ts for the
 * measured number.
