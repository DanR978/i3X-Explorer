/**
 * Radial layout for an ego graph: the root at the center, one concentric ring
 * per hop. Distance from the center IS the depth, which is the whole point of a
 * configurable-depth view (a force blob would place a 3-hop node anywhere).
 *
 * Rings are FIXED and compact. They used to grow to fit every label, which made
 * a 500-child ring thousands of units across: the fitted view shrank the whole
 * map to dust and the side labels still stacked. Now geometry never depends on
 * text — the renderer draws dots and labels at constant *screen* size and culls
 * labels by each node's angular slot at the current zoom (semantic zoom), so
 * the fitted view is always a readable compact map and zooming in resolves any
 * crowd: screen separation between ring neighbors grows linearly with zoom.
 *
 * Angles come from a weighted sector allocation down the BFS tree: each node
 * hands its children a slice of its own sector, sized by how many descendants
 * each carries. Siblings therefore stay together and tree edges never cross.
 * The slot each node owns is exported — it is exactly the label-culling
 * priority: heavy subtrees (the hubs worth reading first) own wide slots and
 * label first; sliver-slot leaves appear as you zoom. Non-tree edges (a node
 * reachable two ways) are drawn as chords across the rings, since those
 * crossings are real information, not layout noise.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic: same graph in, same picture out, no simulation and no
 * jitter between renders.
